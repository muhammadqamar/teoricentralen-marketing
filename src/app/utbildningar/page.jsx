              I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote
              my first program when I was 6 years old, just two weeks after my
              mom brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I taught
              myself to type on.

              The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was space.
              When I was 8, I climbed the 40-foot oak tree at the back of our
              yard while wearing my older sister’s motorcycle helmet, counted
              down from three, and jumped — hoping the tree was tall enough that
              with just a bit of momentum I’d be able to get to orbit.
